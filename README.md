# Spelling Game

Its a spelling game that allows the user to match an object with its correct spelling. 
Spelling Game intends to help kids to improve their vocabulary as well as visualization. It contains 48 levels. Each level has a list of emoji and a list of spelling. The user needs to drag the emoji and drop it on the correct spelling. A nice sound will be played upon correct spelling. An interesting feature is that the app will not allow the user to drop the emoji on incorrect spelling, which motivates as well as helps the user to learn quickly. The design of the app is simple and without animations to give the user a touch of books.
